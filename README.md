# basikuro
A minimal skin for OpenTaiko, ported from TJAPlayer3.

The original skin is named "basik". I really like it, so I decided to port it to OpenTaiko. This port aims to be as accurate as possible, while adding new graphics for OpenTaiko-exclusive features.

This branch is what I will consider to be the "primary branch", as I will mainly be making changes here, using the 720p branch for pre-existing graphics and such. When this skin is finished, the main branch will be deleted.
